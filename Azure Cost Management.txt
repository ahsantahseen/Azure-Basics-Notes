Azure Costs Factors:

Azure's costs depends on many factors depending on the resources we use.

- Azure TCO Calculator helps us calculate the total cost of the ownership
  when we are migrating our workloads to azure from on-premises infratstructure.

- Azure Pricing Calculator helps us to calculate the operational costs of our resources
  that we use on azure on a monthly basis

- Azure Advisor helps us to monitor our resources costs and prevents 
  over budgedting.

- CapEx / OpEx (Capital Costs, Operational Costs)
- Azure shifts development costs from CapEx of building out and mainting a on-site 
infrastructure to OpEx of renting infrastructure as you need it, whether it's compute 
, storage  and networking etc.

OpEx costs can be impacted by many factors, such as:

1. Resource Type
2. Consumption
3. Maitainence 
4. Geography
5. Subscription Type
6. Marketplace


Resouce Types:

- Regions impact on the resource price
- When you create a resouce Azure creates are metered instance for that resource
- Meter tracks your resource usage and generates a usage record for the billing

    - For Example: You specify type of storage blob (HOT,COOL,ARCHIVE) creating them in dfferent regions but same specs will show you different cost.

Consumption:

    - Pay-as-you-go model
    - Azure offers ability to commit resoures with a discounted price upto 72%

Pricing Calculators:

 - Designed to give me estimated cost for provisioning resources in Azure.

 TCO Calculator:
 ---------------
    - Designed to compare costs of running resources in cloud and on-premesis
    - Additonally assumes other costs like Labor, IT Support and power.

- Azure Pricing Calculator

Cost Mangament in Azure:
------------------------

Azure Cost Mangament Tools is an overall budgeting and monitoring Tool

    - Automate management of resouces (budget wise)
    - Alerts, Billing Cycles

 Types of Cost Alerts:

    - Budget Alerts (Alert on exceeding given budget)
    - Credit Alerts (Alert when azure's monetary commmitments are used, usualy alert at 90% or 100% depeletion)
    - Department Spending Quota Alerts (Alerting when department's spending reaches are specific threshold)

Tags can help you visualize all of the resources that participate in complex deployments. For example, you might tag a resource with its associated workload or application name
and use software such as Azure DevOps to perform automated tasks on those resources.

Tags are key value pairs in azure.
