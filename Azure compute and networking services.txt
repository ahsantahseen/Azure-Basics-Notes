
Azure Virtual Machines:
=======================

Azure Virtual Machines offer you IaaS virtualization. They offer the option similar 
to any cloud Virtual machines like os, custom software, custom hosting etc.

Azure Offers Scaling for it's VMs as well.

    - Virtual Machines Scale Sets:

     Well Virtual Machine Scale sets offer a dynamic load balancing solution
     by upscaling or downscaling VMs depening on the demand that it's getting,
     it has it's own load balancer and the user can configure the load balancer 
     as well as the virtual machine scale set.

     - Virtual Machine Availability Sets:

     Availability Sets are there, to Ensure your VMs are upto-date and properly connected via power and networking
     so that it can prevent your VMs from a power failure or single network failure.

     They work like that, 

     - In terms of Updating, it uses Update Groups and what it does is that it groups VMs togather and
       ensures only one group will be down at a time for update, while machines in that update group will
       be updating while other update groups will continue to run.

       An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts. 

     - In terms of fault like networking and power, it groups VMs based on the same 
       power source and network switch and it groups by 3 fault domains so VMs are to be 
       secured from power losses for instance on group gets offline the other would function.

    More over, there's no additional costs for the Availability groups just need 
    to pay for the VMs that were used for it.

Azure Virtual Desktops
======================

Well Azure Virtual Desktop is similar to it's name, but here you have a complete virtualized enviornment
with native feel, your Windows can be completely virtualized with it's own seperate storage server and other resources in a shared
enviornment, so the risk of data theft on personal devices will be gone as now the data would be residing on a server rather than the host.

It offers multi-usage meaning two or more collaborating on the virtualized Desktop at the same time, it supports apps like Office365 and OneNote.

It has a centralized security management for users' desktop with AD and Multifactor Authentication and also RBAC SECURITY.

Azure Containers
================

Well when you want to save money on your resources of your applications then containers is the way to go that runs on a sinlge host.

Containers are lightweight enviornments that don't require their own operating system and work on a single host. They can be scaled-up and down dynamically.
We won't need to manage any OS configurations in containers, they are more lightweight and agile compared to virtual machines.

One of the popular container engine, Dockers is supported by Azure and is widly used.

Azure Container Instances is an PaaS, offering you to create your own containers on it's container engine.

Containers are mainly used where performance and portability matters for applications and flexibility matters for an application the it is used VM.

Azure Serverless functions
==========================

No need to manage the server, just run your code on the server and pay per use model.
You just need to pay for the excecution time of that code on the server enviornment.

There are three advantages in Serverless computing

1. No Administration for the server
2. No configurations for the server
3. Highly Scaleable

Serverless functions on azure can be stateful or stateless. By default they are stateless, so if they are stateless they would restart every time to respond to an event
while in stateful, an context is passed through out the function to track prior activity.

Azure App Services:
===================

Azure App Services enables us to build pretty much anything like RESTful APIS, Backends for Mobiles, Background Crons Jobs.
Without actually managing the infrastructure. It will offer you automatic scaling and high availability.

App service supports linux and windows. It offers you to setup an CI/CD enviornment for those apps as well.
App service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web and mobile apps and mobile backends.

Azure Virtual networking:
========================

Azure has it's virtual networks and subnets that enables services like VMs, web apps, databases to communicate with each other
or with the public network aka internet or with your on-premisis infrastructure.

Azure virtual network provides:

 - Isolation and Segmentation:

        With Azure, you can create multiple isolated networks with each having
        their own subnets and IP ranges, however these IP ranges are not internet routable.
        For name resolution, we use Azure DNS to confiure the private network to internal or external DNS sever.

 - Internet Communication:

        You can enable incoming public traffic to an resource in azure using an Public IP address or putting that 
        resource on a public network load balancer as this way you have to add the public ip.

 - Communicate between Azure resources:

        You can use Azure Virtual Networks and create a virtual private network to communicate between 
        resrouces in azure or you can also opt for service endpoitns like SQL Dbs and Storage account links.

 - Communicate with on-premisis resources:

        - Point to site VPN
        - Site to Site VPN
        - Azure Express Route

 - Route network traffic
 - Filter network traffic
 - Connect virtual networks together

 Azure offers both Public and Private communication endpoints, both have seperate
 IPs for communication.
