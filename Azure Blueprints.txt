Azure Blueprints
=================

 - Helps to Standardize cloud subscription/enviorments deploymnets
 - Azure Blueprints can use to define repeatable settings and policies
   that are applied as new subscriptions are created.
- If we want to create a new Test/Dev enviorment with security and compliance
  settings already configured, use a Blueprint.

Artifacts:

 - Each Component in blueprint is Artifact
 - Artifacts can have no configuration like an SQL
   server policy that be Default don't need addiotnal 
   configs.
- Artifacts can have one ore more parameters that you can configured
- Artifacts include:
 
    - Role assignments
    - Policy assignments
    - Azure Resource Manager templates
    - Resource Groups

-Azure Blueprints are version-able, 
allowing you to create an initial configuration 
and then make updates later on and assign a new version to the update.
