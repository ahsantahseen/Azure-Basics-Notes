
Azure Physical Infrastructure
=============================

- Regions:
    - Availability Zones

Azure's Physical Infrastructure is divided in to two parts:

1. Physical Infrastructure

Azure has it's own large datacenters, racks of resources including
    - Power
    - Cooling
    - Networking Infrastructure

Azure's Datacenters are divided into regions which are then divided into 
availability zones.

   * Regions: A region is a geographical area in the world which contains atleast
             one or more particular datacenter nearby networked together with
             a low-latency netowrk infrastructure. Azure automatically assings
             and controls the resources within each region to ensure the workloads
             are properly balanced.

             Although we need choose a region whenever we are deploying our resources
             on azure.
    
   * Global / Region Specific Resouces: Azure Active Directory, Azure DNS and Azure Traffic Managers 
                                       are global resources that are not bound to a region,
                                       while VMs and Storage Sizes are specific to the regions 
    
  *  Availability Zones: Azure physically seprates it's datacenters located in a region among availability-zones
                        
                        - Each AZ is equiped with it's own independent power, cooling and networking.
                        - Each AZ is isolated, if one goes down the other continously works.
                        - They are connected via Private Fiber Optic Cable.
                        - To ensure resilency, a minimum of three seprate availability zones are present
                          in all zone-enabled regions.
                        - Primarly, they are made for VMs, managed disks, load balencers and Databases.

                    Azure Classifies Resourecs/Services that supports AZs into three categories:

                        - Zonal Serivces: You pin the resource to a specific zone (VMs, IP addresses, Disks)
                        - Zone-redundant Services: Platform replicates accross multiple AZs (SQL DBs, Redundant Storage)
                        - Non-regional Services: Services are always availabile availabile throughout the regions

    Azure Provides Region Pairs for applications that impact multiple AZs in a single region.

Region Pairs:

Most Azure Regions are paired with another region within the same 
geography (such as US, Europe or Asia) atleast has to be 300 miles away.

This approach allows for the replication of resources accross a geography
that helps reduce interuptions like natural disaster, civil unrest, power outage etc.
So if one regions falls offline-then the next region will be activated as a fail over region.

Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region.
In these scenarios, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer.

Like US East and US West are paired up with each other, because both are far apart enough to isolate from natural disasters.

    Advantages For Region Pairs:

        1. Prevents Outages on Region Levels
        2. Protection from Tax and Data Laws (Like in France you can't take out the data, but in other region you can)

    Important About Directions in Region Pairing:

        Most Regions are paired in two directions, like both regions are backup for one another

       US EAST <------> US WEST
       
       Here US EAST is a backup for US WEST and US WEST is a backup for US EAST,
       Although there are some pairs that are only one direction. LIke West India 
       and Brazil South.

       WEST INDIA <------------ South India

       Here, South India is a backup for a West India but South India does not rely on west india for it's backup.

       Sovereign Regions are like isolated from main azure like China and US-Gov, DoD etc.



2. Management Infrastructure:

Well, the managemnet infrastructure includes azure resources and resource groups,
subscriptions and accounts. Understanding the hierarchical organziation will help you 
plan your projects and products

    -Azure Resources and Resource Groups:

    * Everything we create in Azure EcoSystem is considered as an resource
    * Each Resource needs to be put in an Resource Group.
    * Some Resources may need to be moved between groups but once you move
      the former group will no longer be associated with that resource.
    * No! You cannot make nested groups
    * Action on Resource Group will affect on all the resources in the resource group

    * It is best to group resources based on access schema and then assign access 
    schemea at resource level.

    - Azure Billing:

    Similar like Resource Groups but more on the billing side and authoirzation
    access on different resources on azure. Subscriptions links are stored in an
    Azure Active Directory.

    Accounts can have mutliple subscriptions but only one is required.
    Subscriptions can be used to put boundaries on limting resources.

    You have two types of boundaries:

    1. Billing boundaries
    2. Access Control boundaries

    - Azure Management Groups:

    Well if you're managing a large organziation with multiple teams and in different regions.
    Then you would need to manage them efficiently, so we have to organize our subscriptions into 
    seperate management groups where you can apply governance conditions to the management groups.
    All subscriptions within a management group will inherit the conditions applied to that management group.

        - You can make a nested hierarchical structure in Azure Management Groups

        Use Cases for Azure Mangament Groups:

         - hierarchical policy:  For instance you need to limit the number of VMs in US-West Production Group.
                             so all the subscriptions under that management group will be affected and they cannot
                             alter that policy which makes a better governance.
    
        - We can also provide user access to multiple subscriptions by using Azure Role Based Access Control or RBAC.
         assign one role in the Mangament group and that role can access subscriptions under that management

        Important Facts About Management Groups:

            * 10,000 Management Groups can be supported under single Azure Directory
            * Management Tree can be upto 6 levels of depth.
            * Each Management Group and Subscriptions can support only one parent.
