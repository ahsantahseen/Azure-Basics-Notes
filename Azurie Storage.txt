Azure Storage Services:
=======================

Well basically Azure Provides 5 Types of Storage Services on the Cloud.
Both HTTP/HTTPS Protocols are supported by Azure on the web.

1. Azure Blob Storage (Pure Text/Binary Storage best for Images, Docs,Streaming Services etc on the web)
2. Azure Queue Storage (Simple Application Messaging Queue Service when applications are communicating with each other)
3. Azure Disk Storage (Fully Managed Storage For VMs)
4. Table Storage (noSQL Key Pair Storage)
5. Azure Files Storage (Similar to S3, like a bucket)


    Azure has 3 tiers:

    1. Hot (Mostly Accessed)
    2. Cool (Less Frequent Access)
    3. Archieve (Long Term Cold Storage) 


    Storage Types:

    Standard Type : Supported for all services, Gneneral Purpose
    Premium Block Blobs: Blob Storage (including Data Lake)
    Premium File Shares: Azure File Storage purposes
    Premium Page Blobs: Page Blobs Only

    Storage Account Endpoints in Azure:

    When naming your storage account, keep these rules in mind:

        Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
        Your storage account name must be unique within Azure. 
        No two storage accounts can have the same name. 
        This supports the ability to have a unique, accessible namespace in Azure.

Azure Storage Redundancy
========================

Azure will always store multiple copies of your data, it's called Redundancy. Now what happens is that Azure protects your data from various unforseen consequnces.
So to ensure your data's safety it stores on multiple places so that it can be highly available and durable.

When considering Redundancy we need the following options to chose

 * How your data is replicated in the primary region
 * Decide the secondary region for disaster recovery (Must chose far apart places incase of natrual disasters)
 * Applcations access to secondary data if primary goes down

Primay Region Redundancy:
-------------------------

Data in the Azure Storage's Primary Region is replicated always 3 times, although
azure does give you two options

    - Store Data in Locally Redundant Storage
    - Zone Redundant Storage

    Locally Redundant Storage:

        LRS, replicates your data three times within a single data center in the 
        primary region. LRS provides atleast 11 nines durability (99.999999999%) of objects 
        over a given year.

        Pros:

        - Cheaper Option

        Cons: 

        - Less Durable
        - Risk of Loss is more since a single data-center
        
    Zone Redundant Storage:

        ZRS, replicates your data over three AZs syncronously. 
        ZRS provides atleast 12 nines durability of objects over a given year.

        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/zone-redundant-storage-6dd46d22.png
        
        Pros:

        - Accessible if a zone becomes unavailable since there are 2 more.
        - No remounting required for file shares
        - High availablity within a region

        Cons: 

        - Costly Options (Financal Standpoint)


Redundancy in Secondary Region:
-------------------------------

Well applications that require highly available data, opt for redundancy in secondary region
that is far apart from primary region which saves from a natural disaster or any unforseen consequnces
happeing in the primary region.

The secondary region is based on the region's pairs and it can't be changed.

Azure Offers you:

    - Geo-Redundant Storage Similar to LRS

    - Geo-Zone Redundant Storage Similar to ZRS

A failover affects a primary region and it cannot recover than the RPO to the secondary region would be less than 15 mins
Due to which secondary region may not be up-to-date.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:

Azure Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
Azure Queues: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
Azure Disks: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Azure Blob Storage:

Well Blob Storage is an object storage solution to store raw text/binary data in the cloud.
It is not limited any format, meaning you can have unstructured binary data.
Data from any scientific instrumemt, streaming data, massive videos, encrypted data, you name it.

It has a advantage over disk storage is that you can upload blobs without having the worry of your disk size
since azure takes of that while in disk storage (block-level) you would need to be worried about your disk size.

Blob storage is ideal for:

Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
Storing files for distributed access.
Streaming video and audio.
Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Accessing Blob:

    - Via HTTP/HTTPS
    - Blob URLS
    - Azure Cli, PowerShell
    - Client Libraries for Java,Node.js etc.

Storage Tiers:

    - Hot
    - Cool
    - Archieve

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Files:

Azure Files is an mounted File System solution either on cloud or on-premisis.
It supports both SMB and NFS protocols. Azure File Sync caches SMB files to
fast access nearby, where the data is being used currently.

    Benefits:

    - Offers both SMB/NFS so you can replace your on-premises File Share with 
      Azure File Share without comptability issues.
    - Fully Managed as Azure Takes care of the hardware, OS, security.
    - Easily accessible via PowerShell and Azure Cli.
    - Highly Resilient without any power,network issues.
    - Familar Programming with easy to integrate via Client Libraries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Queue Storage:

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. Once stored, you can access the messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue can contain as many messages as your storage account has room for (potentially millions). 
Each individual message can be up to 64 KB in size. 
Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.

Queue storage can be combined with compute functions like Azure Functions to take an action when a message is received. 

For example, you want to perform an action after a customer uploads a form to your website. 
You could have the submit button on the website trigger a message to the Queue storage. 
Then, you could use Azure Functions to trigger an action once the message was received.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Disk Storage:

It is a block storage Azure VMs, Conceptually same as physical disk but are virtualized and connected to the VM via a network.
