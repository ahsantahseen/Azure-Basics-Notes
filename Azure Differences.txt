Difference B/W Availability Sets and Fault Tol.

Availability Sets are used to protect applications
from hardware failres within an AZ.
while Fault Tolerance is across multiple AZs

Diff B/w Azure Express Route and VPN Gatway

Well both work same but ER uses a private 
connection while VPN Gateway uses a public
connection.

Azure Policy is RBAC pre-deployment practice, A lock is something that are
post-deployment practice

Azure Application Gateway is Security Based
Load Balancer on layer 7 and Virtual Gateway is a layer 3
network device that is used to connect.

Azure Firewall monitors for all traffic for
workloads while NSG will monitor for individual
virtual networks, subnets and network interfaces
for virtual machiens to refine traffic. 
NSG works on allow or deny or ACL

availability sets are used to protect applications from 
hardware failures within an Azure data center, availability zones, protect applications from complete Azure data center failures.
