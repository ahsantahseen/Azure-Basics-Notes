Azure Directory services
========================

What is Active Directory?

It's an Identity and Access Management Service provided 
by Microsoft on Windows Server to manage accounts on 
the network (on-premises).
-------------------------------------------

Since microsoft cannot maintain your (on-premises) AD, it Offers
Azure AD which is an Cloud Based IAM serivce. With Azure AD, you can
add many security features that are managed by Microsoft

Such as :

 - MFA / 2FA
 - Detect Suspiecious Logins

Azure AD helps you protect your Identity and Access Management
at no extra cost involved.

You can transfer our on-premises AD to Azure AD to tighten it's 
security since microsoft will monitor your IAM.

Azure AD is used by many people like:

    - IT Admins
    - App Developers (For SSO functionality)
    - Users (IAM maintain and Password reset)
    - Online Subscription Serviecs (Office 365, Microsft Dynamics CRM)

Azure AD provides services such as:

Authentication: This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources. 
                It also includes providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multifactor authentication,
                 a custom list of banned passwords, and smart lockout services.

Single sign-on: Single sign-on (SSO) enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. 
                A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, 
                access modifications are tied to that identity, which greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts.

Application management: You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Azure AD. 
                        Features like Application Proxy, SaaS apps, the My Apps portal, and single sign-on provide a better user experience.

Device management:  Along with accounts for individual people, Azure AD supports the registration of devices. 
                    Registration enables devices to be managed through tools like Microsoft Intune. 
                    It also allows for device-based Conditional Access policies to restrict access attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the requesting user account.

    Azure AD Connect, helps you connect your on-premises AD with Azure AD and syncronizes it.
    This means that you can use both now with Microsoft's support and monitoring.
